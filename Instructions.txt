To run the interpreter: python3 final.py

Make sure to change the file name to the Program that you are running in the final.py on line 38, For example if
we are trying to run Program1.pe, the line 38 will look like "fp = open("Program1.pe", "r")", if we are trying
to run the Program2.pe, it will look like "fp = open("Program2.pe", "r")" and if we are trying
to run the Program2.pe, it will look like "fp = open("Program5.pe", "r").
